- The associated [Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/eric-r-xu/DiscardWisdom/blob/main/DiscardWisdom.ipynb) utilizes game screenshots from the Hong Kong Mahjong Club mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hong-kong-mahjong-club/id488514298), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recax.mjclub&hl=en_US)) for tile image recognition. 
- It analyzes all discarded tiles and calculates a hand score after each discard. 
- The higher the hand score from each discarded tile, the less useful the algorithm predicts it is for maximizing your win and thus should be discarded from your hand.

### Key Features/Notes

__Tile Image Recognition__: Utilizes game screenshots to accurately recognize and analyze tiles played and discarded

__Discard Analysis__: Strategically and comprehensively analyzes all discarded tiles during gameplay, calculating a hand score after each discard. The ML algorithm predicts the usefulness of each tile, strategically recommending discards that enhance offensive and defensive strategies.

__Automation with Autoplay Functionality__: Includes a script (mahjong/autoplay.py) that leverages image recognition and motion control to automate gameplay. This feature collects game screenshots and compiles game statistics to inform future enhancements.

__Platform__: Uses Jupyter and Google Colab notebooks for public execution and sharing.
