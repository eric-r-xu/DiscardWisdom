The Google Colab notebook uses screenshots from the Hong Kong Mahjong Club mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hong-kong-mahjong-club/id488514298), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recax.mjclub&hl=en_US)) to do image recognition and calculate a score for each possible tile you can discard to help maximize your probability of winning.
